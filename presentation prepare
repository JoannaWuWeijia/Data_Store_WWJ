##  Matplotlib 

Matplotlib is a library designed for plotting and arranging data visually in Python, usually in twodimensional. It was created by Dr. John Hunter in 2003 to enable a MATLAB-like plotting interface in Python
Matplotlib is widely used because of its simplicity and effectiveness.

The library can be installed using either `pip` or `conda`. 

Type "pip install matplotlib" in your terminal

There are several types of graphs such as:
1. Lineplot
2. Barplot
3. Scatterplot
4. 3D plot

Let's give an simple example:
```{python}
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
y = [i**2 for i in x]
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8)) # Width, height in inches
plt.plot(x, y)
```
